I am a PhD student at Zhejiang University, focusing on **human-robot motion imitation learning**, under the supervision of Professor Rong Xiong. I received the B.S degree from the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2020. My latest research interests include **robot skill learning** and **transfer learning**.
